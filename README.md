# Global-Weather-Data-Analysis

The goal of this project was to analyze weather data related to maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed for over 500 randomly selected global cities. Since the baseline data was collected from the Open Weather Map API, Python with Numpy, Citipy, Requests, Pandas, and Matplotlib (through Jupyter Notebooks) was used to clean and process the data, as well as display the desired outputs.

## Questions

1. Is there a correlation between latitude and maximum temperature? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?
2. Is there a correlation between latitude and humidity? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?
3. Is there a correlation between latitude and cloudiness? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?
4. Is there a correlation between latitude and wind speed? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?
